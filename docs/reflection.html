                I created a web portfolio using both GitHub Pages and WordPress. Generally, they share the same content, but feature different styles. Both methods of creating a website have their own pros and cons.

                Using GitHub Pages involves writing code in HTML and CSS to create stylized web pages that can then be accesses through a link on GitHub if configured properly. 
                Although I am somewhat familiar with coding in HTML, CSS, and GitHub, I would say that the largest potential challenges for someone trying to learn this method of website creation would be learning the optimal GitHub workflow and understanding the intricacies of CSS.
                GitHub commands may be tricky to understand at first for a beginner, and CSS can quickly become confusing when nested elements or margins/padding are involved. 
                The main advantages of using this method would be the high level of control that can be had over the stylization and the ability to easily have multiple people working on the website.
                GitHub is very collaborative in nature, and commits can be tracked to see how a given web project is progressing. In many cases, however, the organization and layout of the pages will need to be built
                from the ground up. There are some resources such as Bootstrap that can help to make the start of a project less daunting, but sometimes issues can arise later where Bootstrap's stylizing conflicts with other changes you want to make to the style of given webpage elements.
                Generally, one will want to have some basic skills in coding and an understanding of organization and design to make a GitHub Pages website. In my case, I want to continue learning how to make my CSS styling more appealing to the eye.
                This might involve learning a bit more about general color theory or studying how other websites organize their pages.

                WordPress, on the other hand, involves utilizing the premade interfaces the organize and format a website on a higher level. 
                New learners may struggle with understanding all of the options available to them at any given time while creating web pages.
                Nevertheless, using the interfaces and premade themes of WordPress can make creating a website a very quick process. This speed is mostly attributed to the fact that WordPress
                has many pre-existing assets that create a situation where one does not need to build their website from the ground up. To some extent, one does not even need a deep understanding of HTML or CSS to create a nice-looking website.
                Although, these pre-existing assets can be tricky to modify, and WordPress is generally more limited than pure HTML and CSS.
                The skills needed for developing a website in WordPress are less demanding than for GitHub Pages. One might only need basic knowledge in web page organization and an understanding of the interfaces of WordPress.
                In my case, I want to improve my understanding of the interfaces, since I am still very new to WordPress and am not completely familiar with all that it can offer in terms of stylizing.

                Both GitHub Pages and WordPress provide viable ways to create websites. Even though I prefer using GitHub Pages, I think that either tool could be effective in producing a basic web portfolio.
