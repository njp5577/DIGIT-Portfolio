                For this text analysis, I chose to work with presidential inaugural addresses and State of the Union speeches given during the 21st century. This includes presidents inbetween and including George W. Bush and Joe Biden. 
                Most of the text samples were retrieved from the introDH-Hub text file collection, but some additional text documents were added to make the text set as up to date as possible (Biden and Trump's latest State of the Union Addresses).
                Through this analysis, I hope to compare how the latest presidents tend to handle each kind of speech and identify any kind of trends.

                Naturally, both kinds of speeches contain heavy use of language that is meant to empower the idea of patriotism as most easily seen in the Voyant word clouds. This is hinted at through the use of words such as "america", "american", "work", "great", and so on. 
                Nevertheless, the word clouds from Voyant show that each kind of speech has its own unique purpose. The inaugural address seems to be more broadly tied to general values held within the United States with words like "justice", "freedom", "power", and other values. 
                Meanwhile, the State of the Union addresses are more aimed at addressing issues with words such as "economy", "jobs", "tax", and so on. The 3-grams for each also show these trends. Both kinds of speeches contain heavy usage of unifying phrases, but the State of the Union addresses contrast by having many references to "the middle east" and "democrats and republicans".
