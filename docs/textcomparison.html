                For this text analysis, I chose to work with presidential inaugural addresses and State of the Union speeches given during the 21st century. This includes presidents inbetween and including George W. Bush and Joe Biden. 
                Most of the text samples were retrieved from the introDH-Hub text file collection, but some additional text documents were added to make the text set as up to date as possible (Biden and Trump's latest State of the Union Addresses).
                Through this analysis, I hope to compare how the latest presidents tend to handle each kind of speech and identify any kind of trends.

                Naturally, both kinds of speeches contain heavy use of language that is meant to empower the idea of patriotism as most easily seen in the Voyant word clouds. This is hinted at through the use of words such as "america", "american", "work", "great", and so on. 
                Nevertheless, the word clouds from Voyant show that each kind of speech has its own unique purpose. The inaugural address seems to be more broadly tied to general values held within the United States with words like "justice", "freedom", "power", and other values. 
                Meanwhile, the State of the Union addresses are more aimed at addressing issues with words such as "economy", "jobs", "tax", and so on. The 3-grams for each also show these trends. Both kinds of speeches contain heavy usage of unifying phrases, but the State of the Union addresses contrast by having many references to "the middle east" and "democrats and republicans".

                When looking at the 4-grams in AntConc, some more precise trends can be seen. Generally, they tend to encapsulate the strategies that each individual president tended to use to appeal to the audience.

                Starting with the inaugural addresses, most 4-grams are common phrases unique to each president with some exceptions for very common phrases used across most inaugural speeches. For example, President Obama tended to emphasize the "journey" and the need to follow through and "complete" it within his second inaugural speech. 
                This might be especially relevant, since this was the start of his second term. He likely deemed it important to assure the people that he would stay dedicated to following through on his goals for the country.

                On the other hand, the 4-grams for the State of the Union addresses were a lot more broad mostly showing general phrases and sentiments regarding the United States. Although, there were some notable outliers that could open the door for further analysis. In my case, I decided to look into the phrase "over the next years" to get a glimpse into how recent presidents referred to and planned for the future. 
                Conveniently, when looking at the phrase and its uses, the year amounts were also provided. Interestingly, the amount of years used in this phrase seems to have trended upward which could indicate a heavier focus on the later future. The context of the phrase is also interesting. 
                It tends to be used alongside statistics to illustrate plans that pursued.

                Clusters tend to follow similar trends to that of n-grams mostly conveying the purpose of each type of speech. An example is given in the images below for "America's".

                In the inaugural speeches, "America's" is used mostly in conjunction with common values such as faith, prosperity, and freedom. Meanwhile, State of the Union addresses use it to focus more on pressing politic issues involving the economy, energy, and the future. 
                In both cases, "America's" is one of many unifying phrases meant to bring the people together to empower their collective values and face ongoing issues. Interestingly, this is a common strategy used among all of the presidents whose speeches are being analyzed through this text analysis.
