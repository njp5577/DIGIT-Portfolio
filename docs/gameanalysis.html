                For the Game Analysis Assignment, I decided to do an analysis on Return. Return is a 2D hack and slash style game with a sci-fi aesthetic. 
                The version of this game being reviewed is the alpha version that can be found on itch.io. Although, there is a more complete version available for purchase on Steam. 
                A Kumu network is provided below for a more visual representation of Return's gameplay aspects.

                The game begins by giving a short text explanation of the player character's situation. It establishes that the 
                player has returned to an apocalyptic version of their home planet where they must try to survive. The player is then met 
                with the first area of the game and the game's pixelated artstyle.

                Return utilizes 2D pixel artwork along with pixelated particle effects to make the game look sharper. 
                It also uses many dark, rich colors alongside some dull colors to make the atmosphere seem lively, yet still creepy. This creates a feeling of loneliness 
                that will eventually be interrupted through combat. The player character themself appears to be some kind of soldier in a dark colored suit with a white mask and/or window on the front of their helmet. 
                Many of the animations are quick to make the actions in the game very responsive, since the player will be in tense combat situations. 
                The audio compliments the visuals by mainly consisting of droning ambient tracks that intensifies the more mysterious elements of the world.

                The locations are simple, yet still detailed through the use of multi-layered 2D backgrounds. For example, a forest is constructed with multiple layers of sequentially shaded tree groups to give depth. 
                The locations are somewhat limited in exploration as to incentivize puzzle solving and combat. Color palette is the main indicator of different kind of areas. The inside of a structure will use many reds while outside uses many greens for example.

                The main gameplay elements that the player will be experiencing within these areas are combat and interaction. The player has the choice of using their sword or their pistol. 
                The sword is short range but it can be used infinitely. The pistol is long range but has limited uses based on the player's current ammo reserves. Learning how to use the sword in easier combat situations is important, 
                because the player will likely need the pistol for more dangerous encounters where they can not afford to get too close.

                Although, the player also has access to some consumable items such as health potions which can help to 
                lighten the blow of minor mistakes on the player's part. These consumables, along with other items, can be accessed and sorted through the inventory.

                The player is also incentivized to interact with their surroundings to learn more about the game's story. For example, the player can read logs from a console upon getting through the cave section 
                to learn about someone's attempt to stop a supercomputer from reanimating the dead. Unfortunately, they were stopped by attacking marauders. Aside from sparse writings left over for the player, the only other character interactions 
                come in the form of brief, silent encounters the player may have while traversing areas. The player may stumble into the silent merchant with whom they can purchase supplies, they may encounter a flashback sequence of a soldier being slain, and a handful of other similar interactions. 
                Many of the puzzles in the game are fairly easy either being a search for a key or copying of a code found elsewhere.

            <p class="essay">
                In general, the alpha version of Return has an aesthetic and basic gameplay that seems to be thoroughly developed, but it lacks some narrative elements and worldbuilding 
                that would make the story more comprehensive. Although from what I have seen of the Steam version, the game has many more cutscenes and descriptions, so this issue has likely already been addressed.
